### Example Scenario

Post-acute care patients are typically complex from a healthcare perspective and have many stops during their healthcare journey (as shown in Figure 1).  As the patient moves from one healthcare setting to another, it is important that their [functional/cognitive] data travel with them so that the new healthcare setting has the most complete information about that patient so they can provide the best care.

### Assessment Data Exchange

In Figure 2, the patient is admitted to Healthcare Setting A due to the result of an adverse event, such as a stroke.  Healthcare setting A performs a set of Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) cognitive assessments, first by a registered nurse (e.g. at admission) and later, by a physical therapist (e.g. at discharge).  The results of the CAM cognitive assessments are captured in the electronic health record (EHR) system of Healthcare Setting A.

Upon discharge, Healthcare Setting A refers the patient to Healthcare Setting B.  When the patient arrives at Healthcare Setting B, their clinicians can retrieve the cognitive assessments performed on the patient at Healthcare Setting A, as part of the transfer summary, using the profiles for exchanging cognitive status data defined in this Implementation Guide.

The patient and their family can also access the assessments from Healthcare Setting A at any time through a mobile/web application, so that they are informed about the patientâ€™s care, can track progress, and can be more engaged in their healthcare decisions.
